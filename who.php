    <p>If you are a woman under 20 and you weigh under 10st 3lb or 65kg or are under 5' 6" or 168cm tall you will need to estimate your blood volume to see if you can give blood. If your weight lies between two of the values shown, please use the nearest lower weight.</p><p><u>Female Blood Donors, aged 17-20</u> </p><p>
 
Please find your height and weight and check which box these lines meet.</p>
 
<p>If your estimated blood volume is within the shaded area (i.e. less than 3500ml), unfortunately you are unable to donate until after your 20th birthday. This measure is to minimise the risk of fainting, in accordance with our research. </p>
